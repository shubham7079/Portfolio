## 💎 The Premium Difference

While standard portfolios are static, this engine is built for **velocity** and **interaction**:

-   **🤖 AI Screening Assistant:** Integrated Gemini 3-powered agent that acts as a 24/7 technical recruiter, capable of answering context-aware questions about my stack, projects, and professional availability.
-   **🚀 Build Velocity Marquee:** A continuous, infinite-motion project track demonstrating a "perpetual delivery" mindset.
-   **✨ Kinetic Motion System:** Powered by **Framer Motion**, utilizing custom spring physics for a silk-smooth, "Apple-grade" tactile experience.
-   **⚡ React 19 Concurrent Architecture:** Leveraging the latest React features for sub-1s Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and zero layout shifts (CLS).
-   **🌗 Hybrid Theme Engine:** A seamless, system-aware dark/light transition with persistent state management.

## 📂 Project Logic & Architecture

The app follows a modular component-driven architecture:
-   `App.tsx`: The central orchestrator for motion and global state.
-   `geminiService.ts`: A clean implementation of the Google GenAI SDK for low-latency AI responses.
-   `constants.tsx`: The single source of truth for all engineering data, ensuring easy scalability.
-   `components/`: Decoupled, reusable UI primitives (AIAssistant, Navbar, ProjectCard).
